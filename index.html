                <h1>Game Information !</h1>
                <li> You control a blue square block using the 'A' or 'D' keys to dodge incoming red projectiles, 
                which are represented by other falling red blocks. Colliding with a red block results in failure,
                so your goal is to survive for as long as possible. The longer you stay alive, the more points you accumulate.
                Additionally, the game offers different difficulty levels, each with a corresponding point multiplier. 
                In 'Easy' mode, you earn 1 point for each second of survival, in 'Medium' mode, you earn 2 points per second,
                 and in 'Hard' mode, you earn 3 points per second.
                Choose your difficulty wisely and test your reflexes in this challenging game.</li>
